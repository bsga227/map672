<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
I really appreciate how you set up the coder/cartographer/critique triad. ALthough I have been a GIS practioner since the early 2000's, I would consider myself, up until last year anyway, more in the critique camp - often applyingFoucauldian analysis to population categories and mapping practices. I am also a big fan of some of the folks you mentioned, mainly Brian Harley and Jeremy Crampton. I have taught classes where I challenge students to think about how power flows through maps. Last year, I took a Cartography crash course as a GIS teaching fellow. I learned a lot of the principles that make good, visually appealing maps. The authors are right about the rigid divisions between these camps! I was previously afraid or overly critical of cartography because of the legacy associated with folks like Arthur Robinson (Think maps as objectives, tools of imperialisms, objective, and Brian Berry). It is safe to say that I have been nerding out and thinking a little more about data since last year. It seems current - a way to connect with the rest of the world - to do what we should be doing as geographers. I created some fun labs for my students last semester in a Critical GIS class that included mapping Instagram posts and Google Street View to show gentrification.  I have to admit, I ran into a conceptual wall when the class asked me about APIs and coding. Up until this instant (this course), coding and programming language has been a black box - something skilled nerds do! (I wish I had known more, I have been ripped off a few times on website creation). I was originally drawn to your program because you wed together coding with critical anaylsis. I liked the piece because it takes serious the critical analyses of mapping that geographers have valiantly launched for a very long time, without taking yourselves to seriously. I am somewhat dissapointed with your mapping topics though - what would have a Chuck Norris vs. Jean Claude Van Damme analysis of tweets looked like? I want to know, Perhaps that can be a future project for me. I seriously considered making my profile picture for the course a snapshot I took next to the Van Damme statue in Belgium. Let me finish by saying, I especially appreciated the apporach to Big Data the authors took. I respected the middle approach - obviously Big Data is problematic for many reasons, mainly folks who use it employ what I would call anti-human logics, they abstract people into measurable populations, but that doesn't mean we can't map spatial data at will and see what happens! I am excited to bring concepts of play and experimentation to this course!
